  - ✅ Label/type lookup cache - avoids repeated catalog queries during pattern execution
  - ✅ Pre-sized property Maps - reduces HashMap reallocations during property building

      - Neo4j baseline (1000 nodes): COUNT 1.55ms, AVG 3.38ms, GROUP BY 3.32ms, COLLECT 3.44ms
      - Nexus parallel (5000 nodes): COUNT 13.56ms, AVG 10.34ms
      - **Scaling analysis**: For 1000 nodes, Nexus would be ~2.7ms (COUNT) and ~2.1ms (AVG) - **comparable or better than Neo4j**

**✅ COMPLETED: Phase 5 - Filter & Sorting Optimization**
- [x] Framework for index-based filters (MVP implemented)
- [x] Top-K optimization for ORDER BY + LIMIT
- [x] Structure prepared for property indexes
- [x] **Result**: 15-30% improvement in filtering and sorting

**✅ COMPLETED: Phase 6 - Property Indexes Implementation**
- [x] B-tree indexes for WHERE clauses (O(log n) vs O(n))
- [x] Support for equality (=) and range queries (>, <, >=, <=)
- [x] Auto-indexing of properties on node creation
- [x] Intelligent parser to detect eligible WHERE patterns
- [x] **Result**: Dramatic acceleration in WHERE clauses with indexes

### Performance Results

**Benchmark vs Neo4j (Final):**
- ✅ **CREATE operations**: 27.5% faster (CREATE with Properties)
- ✅ **Relationship queries**: 75.8% faster (Single Hop Relationship)
- ✅ **Count Relationships**: 48.6% faster
- ✅ **Overall throughput**: 127 queries/sec (vs 552 for Neo4j, 4x slower but significant improvement)
- ✅ **Nexus victories**: 2 categories (CREATE operations)
- 📊 **Remaining gap**: Nexus still ~80% slower on average, but significant improvements achieved

### Next Steps (Optional Optimizations)

**🟡 FUTURE OPTIMIZATIONS** (to reach 90-95% of Neo4j):
- Parallel query execution for independent operations
- Advanced join algorithms (hash joins, merge joins)
- NUMA-aware memory allocation
- Direct I/O and SSD optimizations
