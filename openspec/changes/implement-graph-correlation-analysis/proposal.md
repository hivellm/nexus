# Graph Correlation Analysis Implementation

## Overview

This change implements automatic graph generation from Vectorizer data to create visual representations of code relationships, dependencies, and processing patterns. This feature will significantly enhance LLM understanding of codebases by providing structured relationship data.

## Problem Statement

Current LLMs lack understanding of:
- Function call relationships and execution flow
- Module dependencies and import/export patterns
- Data flow and transformation pipelines
- Architectural patterns and component relationships

## Solution

Implement a comprehensive graph correlation analysis system that:
1. Extracts relationship data from Vectorizer collections
2. Generates multiple graph types (call, dependency, data flow, component)
3. Provides interactive visualization and API access
4. Integrates with LLM workflows for enhanced code understanding

## Scope

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)
- Graph data models and basic generation
- Call graph and dependency graph generation
- REST API endpoints for graph access
- Basic visualization support

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (V1)
- Data flow and component graphs
- Pattern recognition and analysis
- Interactive web visualization
- GraphQL API support

### Phase 3: Intelligence Features (V2)
- Machine learning integration
- Real-time graph updates
- Advanced analytics and metrics
- Predictive analysis capabilities

## Success Criteria

- Generate accurate call graphs for codebases up to 10k functions
- Provide dependency graphs with <100ms query response time
- Support interactive visualization with zoom/pan/filter capabilities
- Integrate seamlessly with existing Vectorizer collections
- Achieve 95%+ test coverage for all graph generation components

## Dependencies

- Vectorizer MCP server for data access
- Existing Nexus core infrastructure
- Graph visualization libraries (D3.js, Cytoscape.js)
- Static analysis tools for AST parsing

## Risks

- **Performance**: Large codebases may impact graph generation performance
- **Memory**: Complex graphs may require significant memory resources
- **Accuracy**: Static analysis may miss dynamic relationships
- **Maintenance**: Graph generation logic needs to stay current with code changes

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 4 weeks (MVP implementation)
- **Phase 2**: 6 weeks (Advanced features)
- **Phase 3**: 8 weeks (Intelligence features)

Total: 18 weeks for complete implementation
