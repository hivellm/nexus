**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (75% Complete)  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated**: 3-4 weeks  
**Dependencies**: 
- Cypher parser implementation

- [x] 4.2 Fix labels() function to read from node bitmap via catalog
- [x] 4.3 Fix type() function to read relationship type from catalog
- [x] 4.4 Support queries without explicit nodes (MATCH ()-[r]->())
- [x] 4.5 Implement scan-all-nodes operator for label_id: 0
- [x] 4.6 Fix aggregate functions (COUNT with proper GROUP BY)
- [x] 4.7 Verify MATCH with labels and WHERE clauses
- [x] 4.8 Verify RETURN with aliases
- [x] 4.9 Verify ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses
- [ ] 4.10 Test MATCH queries with multiple labels
- [ ] 4.11 Verify UNION queries

## 5. Server Architecture

- [x] 5.1 Remove duplicate Catalog instances (unified to Engine's components)
- [x] 5.2 Update /stats API to use Engine.stats()
- [x] 5.3 Simplify NexusServer struct
- [x] 5.4 Ensure executor uses Engine's components

## 6. Data Import & Validation

- [x] 6.1 Run full import script (213 files, 11,132 nodes, 3,640 relationships)
- [x] 6.2 Verify data persists after server restart
- [ ] 6.3 Compare import logs between Nexus and Neo4j
- [ ] 6.4 Verify all node types created (Document, Module, Class, Function, etc.)
- [ ] 6.5 Verify all relationship types created (MENTIONS, IMPORTS, etc.)
- [ ] 6.6 Add detailed logging for import process
- [ ] 6.7 Create import validation script

## 7. Comprehensive Testing

- [x] 7.1 Create comprehensive test suite (20 test queries)
- [x] 7.2 Verify 15/20 tests passing (75% pass rate)
- [ ] 7.3 Investigate remaining 5 test failures (data ordering, NULL handling)
- [ ] 7.4 Fix edge cases for 100% compatibility
- [ ] 7.5 Add regression tests
- [ ] 7.6 Create compatibility report generator

## 8. Documentation & Quality

- [ ] 8.1 Update CHANGELOG.md with compatibility improvements
- [ ] 8.2 Update README.md with compatibility status
- [ ] 8.3 Document any intentional differences from Neo4j
- [ ] 8.4 Run all quality checks (lint, test, coverage)
- [ ] 8.5 Verify 95%+ test coverage

## 9. Future Enhancements (Planned)

### 9.1 Multiple Database Support

- [ ] 9.1.1 Design database isolation architecture
- [ ] 9.1.2 Implement database management API (create, drop, list, switch)
- [ ] 9.1.3 Add database selection in Cypher endpoint
- [ ] 9.1.4 Update Engine to support database context switching
- [ ] 9.1.5 Update storage layer for multiple database directories

### 9.2 Property Keys API

- [ ] 9.2.1 Create Property Keys API endpoint (/management/property-keys)
- [ ] 9.2.2 Implement GET /property-keys to list all property keys
- [ ] 9.2.3 Add property key usage statistics
- [ ] 9.2.4 Update admin UI to display property keys
