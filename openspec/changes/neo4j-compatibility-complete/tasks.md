  - ✅ test_relationship_property_access - FIXED (Engine API setup)
  - ✅ test_relationship_property_return - FIXED (Engine API setup)
  - ✅ test_bidirectional_relationship_queries - FIXED (Engine API setup)
  - ⏸️ test_complex_multiple_labels_query - Known bug (result duplication)
  
  Solution Implemented:
  - setup_test_data uses Engine.create_node/create_relationship API
  - Bypasses MATCH ... CREATE limitation

  - All relationship tests now working correctly ✅
  
  Known Bug: Multi-label + Relationship Duplication
