## Phase 1: Implement DELETE Operator (Priority 1)

### 1.1 Add DELETE Operator Infrastructure

### 1.3 Update Query Filtering
- [ ] 1.3.1 Modify `read_node` to skip deleted nodes
- [ ] 1.3.2 Modify `execute_node_by_label` to skip deleted nodes

- [ ] 1.4.2 Test: `MATCH (n:Label) DELETE n` deletes labeled nodes
- [ ] 1.4.3 Test: `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` deletes nodes + relationships
- [ ] 1.4.4 Test: Deleted nodes don't appear in subsequent queries
- [ ] 1.4.5 Run debug-match-create.ps1 to verify cleanup works

- [ ] 2.4.1 Test: `CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})` creates exactly 1 node
- [ ] 2.4.2 Test: Multiple CREATE statements create exact count
- [ ] 2.4.3 Test: MATCH returns correct count after CREATE
- [ ] 2.4.4 Test: No garbage nodes created

- [ ] 3.3.5 Fix any issues in predicate evaluation

### 3.4 Fix Result Set Update
- [ ] 3.4.1 Verify `update_result_set_from_rows` applies filtered rows
- [ ] 3.4.2 Verify result set row count matches filtered count
- [ ] 3.4.3 Ensure filter reduces rows (not passes all through)
- [ ] 3.4.4 Fix any issues in result set update

### 3.5 Fix Filter Ordering
- [ ] 3.5.1 Verify filters apply AFTER NodeByLabel scan
- [ ] 3.5.2 Ensure filters apply BEFORE Cartesian product
- [ ] 3.5.3 Test with multiple patterns to verify correct order
- [ ] 3.5.4 Adjust operator ordering if needed

### 3.6 Testing
- [ ] 3.6.1 Test: `MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Alice'}) RETURN n` returns 1 row
- [ ] 3.6.2 Test: `MATCH (n {age: 30}) RETURN n` filters by property
- [ ] 3.6.3 Test: Multiple inline properties work together
- [ ] 3.6.4 Test: Cartesian product with filters: `MATCH (p1 {name: 'Alice'}), (p2 {name: 'Bob'})`
- [ ] 3.6.5 Run debug-filter.ps1 to verify all tests pass

## Notes

- **Run tests after EACH phase** to verify fixes incrementally
- **Don't proceed to next phase** if current phase fails
- **Keep debug scripts** - they're valuable for future testing
- **Update this document** as new insights discovered
