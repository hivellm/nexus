# Implementation Tasks

## 1. IS NOT NULL Syntax (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 1.1 Add `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` to expression grammar in parser.rs
- [x] 1.2 Add new Expression variant for NULL checks (IsNull, IsNotNull)
- [x] 1.3 Implement evaluation logic in execute_filter
- [x] 1.4 Test `WHERE property IS NULL`
- [x] 1.5 Test `WHERE property IS NOT NULL`
- [x] 1.6 Re-enable test_where_null_check test
- [x] 1.7 Verify query returns count(5) instead of object
- [x] 1.8 Add expression_to_string support for IsNull in planner.rs
- [x] 1.9 Compatibility improved from 88.57% to 91.43%

## 2. WHERE Multiple AND Conditions (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 2.1 Verify parser handles `>=` and `<=` operators
- [x] 2.2 Check AND expression parsing - Found precedence bug
- [x] 2.3 Debug execute_filter for comparison predicates
- [x] 2.4 Implement proper comparison logic for numeric values
- [x] 2.5 Test single condition: `WHERE n.age >= 25`
- [x] 2.6 Test AND condition: `WHERE n.age >= 25 AND n.age <= 35`
- [x] 2.7 Verify query returns correct count (3 nodes aged 25-35)
- [x] 2.8 Test all comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<>`
- [x] 2.9 Refactor parser with proper operator precedence (OR -> AND -> Comparison)
- [x] 2.10 Add test for AND with comparisons
- [x] 2.11 Compatibility improved from 91.43% to 94.29%

## 3. Relationship Property Filtering (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 3.1 Verify relationship properties storage - Working correctly
- [x] 3.2 Check relationship variable accessibility in WHERE - Working
- [x] 3.3 Debug filter evaluation for relationship properties - Fixed by precedence
- [x] 3.4 Implement comparison logic for relationship property access - Already working
- [x] 3.5 Test equality: `WHERE r.since = 2015` - Works
- [x] 3.6 Test comparison: `WHERE r.since >= 2015` - Works
- [x] 3.7 Verify query returns 6 relationships - Fixed!
- [x] 3.8 Fix bidirectional pattern to return each rel twice (Neo4j behavior)
- [x] 3.9 Compatibility improved from 94.29% to 97.14%

## 4. Two-Hop Graph Patterns (Medium Priority) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 4.1 Analyze planner handling of multiple relationship patterns
- [x] 4.2 Check intermediate node tracking - Found bug!
- [x] 4.3 Debug why returning wrong results
- [x] 4.4 Fix: Generate temporary variables for unnamed intermediate nodes
- [x] 4.5 Update prev_node_var to target_var after each Expand
- [x] 4.6 Test two hops: Alice→Charlie, Bob→David (correct!)
- [x] 4.7 Test three hops: working correctly
- [x] 4.8 Verify query returns exactly correct results
- [x] 4.9 Compatibility improved from 97.14% to 100%!

## 5. Testing and Validation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 5.1 Add unit tests for comparison operators - Done
- [x] 5.2 Add unit tests for AND/OR logic - test_and_with_comparisons
- [x] 5.3 Add unit tests for relationship property access - Working
- [x] 5.4 Add unit tests for multi-hop patterns - Tested via integration
- [x] 5.5 Add unit tests for IS NULL / IS NOT NULL - 4 new tests
- [x] 5.6 Run extended-compatibility-test.ps1 - PASSED!
- [x] 5.7 Verify 100% compatibility (35/35 tests) - ✅ ACHIEVED!
- [x] 5.8 Check no regressions in existing tests - All 741 tests passing
