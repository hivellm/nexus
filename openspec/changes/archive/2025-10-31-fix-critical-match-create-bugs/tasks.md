## Final Results

**Neo4j Compatibility:** 100% (17/17 tests passing)

**All Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ `CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})` creates exactly 1 node
- ✅ `MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Alice'}) RETURN n` returns exactly 1 row
- ✅ `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` followed by `MATCH (n) RETURN count(*)` returns 0
- ✅ `MATCH (p1:Person), (p2:Person) RETURN p1, p2` returns 4 rows (2 nodes × 2 nodes)
- ✅ `MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'Alice'}), (p2:Person {name: 'Bob'}) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]->(p2)` creates exactly 1 relationship and 0 new nodes
- ✅ Neo4j compatibility tests pass at 100%
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ All integration tests pass

## Key Fix

**The Only Real Bug:** DELETE parser not recognizing DETACH as clause boundary

**Solution:**
- Added `DETACH` to `is_clause_boundary()` in parser.rs
- Moved DETACH DELETE detection to after keyword parsing
- Parser now correctly splits `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` into 2 clauses

**Impact:**
- DELETE now works → database cleanup works → all other "bugs" resolved
- CREATE was always correct
- FILTER was always correct
- MATCH patterns were always correct
