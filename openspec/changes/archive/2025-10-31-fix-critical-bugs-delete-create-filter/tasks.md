**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: P0 - Blocking  
**Started**: 2025-10-31  
**Completed**: 2025-10-31  
**Actual Time**: ~6 hours

## ðŸŽ‰ **ACHIEVEMENT: 100% Neo4j Compatibility**

All 17 cross-compatibility tests now passing!

## Phase 1: Implement DELETE Operator âœ… COMPLETED

### 1.1 Add DELETE Operator Infrastructure
- [x] 1.1.1 Add `Operator::Delete { nodes: Vec<String> }` enum variant in `mod.rs`
- [x] 1.1.2 Add `Operator::DetachDelete { nodes: Vec<String> }` enum variant
- [x] 1.1.3 Update `plan_query` in planner to recognize Delete clauses
- [x] 1.1.4 Implement `plan_delete` function in planner
- [x] 1.1.5 Generate Delete operator from DeleteClause AST

### 1.2 Implement DELETE Execution
- [x] 1.2.1 Add `execute_delete` function in executor
- [x] 1.2.2 Extract node IDs from context variables
- [x] 1.2.3 Call `RecordStore::delete_node` for each node ID
- [x] 1.2.4 Ensure deleted nodes are marked (not physically removed)
- [x] 1.2.5 Implement DETACH DELETE (delete relationships first)

### 1.3 Update Query Filtering
- [x] 1.3.1 Modify `read_node` to skip deleted nodes
- [x] 1.3.2 Modify `execute_node_by_label` to skip deleted nodes
- [x] 1.3.3 Verify deleted nodes don't appear in MATCH results
- [x] 1.3.4 Add `is_deleted` check in all node scan operations

### 1.4 Testing
- [x] 1.4.1 Test: `MATCH (n) DELETE n` deletes all nodes
- [x] 1.4.2 Test: `MATCH (n:Label) DELETE n` deletes labeled nodes
- [x] 1.4.3 Test: `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` deletes nodes + relationships
- [x] 1.4.4 Test: Deleted nodes don't appear in subsequent queries
- [x] 1.4.5 Run debug-match-create.ps1 to verify cleanup works

**Critical Fix Applied:**
- Added `DETACH` to `is_clause_boundary()` in parser
- Moved DETACH DELETE detection to after keyword parsing
- Fixed: `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` now correctly parsed as 2 clauses (Match + Delete)

## Phase 2: Fix CREATE Duplication âœ… COMPLETED

### 2.1 Investigation
- [x] 2.1.1 Add debug counter to `create_node` function
- [x] 2.1.2 Add logging to `execute_create_query` entry/exit
- [x] 2.1.3 Add logging to track transaction lifecycle
- [x] 2.1.4 Add logging to `refresh_executor` calls
- [x] 2.1.5 Run tests to identify duplication source

### 2.2 Root Cause Fix
- [x] 2.2.1 Verify `execute_create_query` called only once per CREATE
- [x] 2.2.2 Verify `create_node` called only once per node
- [x] 2.2.3 Check if `refresh_executor` triggers duplicates
- [x] 2.2.4 Fix identified root cause
- [x] 2.2.5 Remove debug logging after fix confirmed

**Root Cause:** Database not being cleaned between test runs. CREATE itself was working correctly.

### 2.3 Transaction Handling
- [x] 2.3.1 Verify transaction created only once
- [x] 2.3.2 Verify transaction committed only once
- [x] 2.3.3 Ensure no transaction rollback/retry creating duplicates
- [x] 2.3.4 Add transaction isolation if needed

### 2.4 Testing
- [x] 2.4.1 Test: `CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})` creates exactly 1 node
- [x] 2.4.2 Test: Multiple CREATE statements create exact count
- [x] 2.4.3 Test: MATCH returns correct count after CREATE
- [x] 2.4.4 Test: No garbage nodes created
- [x] 2.4.5 Run debug-match-create.ps1 to verify node count = 2

- [x] 3.1.4 Test with single simple query: `MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Alice'})`
- [x] 3.1.5 Identify which hypothesis is correct

### 3.2 Fix Row Materialization

- [x] 3.5.2 Ensure filters apply BEFORE Cartesian product

### 3.6 Testing
- [x] 3.6.1 Test: `MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Alice'}) RETURN n` returns 1 row
- [x] 3.6.2 Test: `MATCH (n {age: 30}) RETURN n` filters by property
- [x] 3.6.3 Test: Multiple inline properties work together
- [x] 3.6.4 Test: Cartesian product with filters: `MATCH (p1 {name: 'Alice'}), (p2 {name: 'Bob'})`
- [x] 3.6.5 Run debug-filter.ps1 to verify all tests pass

## Key Fixes Summary

### 1. DELETE Parser Bug (Critical)
**Problem:** `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` parsed as single `Match` clause, ignoring `DETACH DELETE`

**Solution:**
1. Added `DETACH` to `is_clause_boundary()` so parser recognizes it as new clause start
2. Moved DETACH DELETE detection to after keyword parsing (not before)
3. Parser now correctly creates 2 clauses: `Match` + `Delete(detach: true)`

**Files Changed:**
- `nexus-core/src/executor/parser.rs`: Added DETACH to clause boundary detection

### 2. CREATE Duplication (Not a Bug)
**Problem:** Multiple nodes created for single CREATE statement

**Solution:**
- Database was not being cleaned between test runs
- CREATE implementation was correct all along
- DELETE fix enabled proper database cleanup

### 3. Inline Filters (Not a Bug)
**Problem:** `MATCH (n {property: value})` returned all nodes

**Solution:**
- Filters were working correctly
- Duplicates from unclean database made it appear broken
- DELETE fix enabled proper testing
