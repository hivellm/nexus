# Neo4j Compatibility Fixes - Phase 2

## Why

Extended cross-compatibility testing revealed 4 remaining incompatibilities with Neo4j (88.57% compatibility rate). These issues prevent full Neo4j compatibility and affect critical query patterns including WHERE clause filtering, relationship traversal, and NULL checking.

## What Changes

- **Add IS NOT NULL / IS NULL syntax support**
  - Implement parser support for NULL check operators
  - Add execution logic for NULL property checks
  - Re-enable previously ignored test

- **Fix WHERE clause with multiple AND conditions**
  - Correct comparison operator evaluation (`>=`, `<=`, `<`, `>`)
  - Fix AND/OR logical operator combination
  - Ensure numeric value comparison works correctly

- **Fix relationship property filtering**
  - Enable WHERE clause access to relationship variables
  - Implement property comparison on relationships
  - Fix filtering logic for relationship properties

- **Fix two-hop graph pattern traversal**
  - Correct multi-hop relationship pattern execution
  - Eliminate duplicate path counting
  - Ensure proper intermediate node tracking

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: `nexus-core` Cypher query execution
- **Affected code**: 
  - `nexus-core/src/executor/parser.rs` - Expression parsing
  - `nexus-core/src/executor/mod.rs` - Query execution and filtering
  - `nexus-core/src/executor/planner.rs` - Query planning for multi-hop patterns
  - `nexus-core/tests/neo4j_behavior_tests.rs` - Re-enable ignored tests

- **Breaking**: No
- **Compatibility improvement**: From 88.57% (31/35) to 100% (35/35) Neo4j compatibility
- **Test impact**: 4 previously failing tests will pass, no regressions expected
