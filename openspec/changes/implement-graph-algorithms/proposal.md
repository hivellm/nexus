# Implement Graph Algorithms (Phase 13)

## Why
Advanced graph analytics capabilities.

## What Changes
- Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, Bellman-Ford)
- Centrality algorithms (PageRank, Betweenness, Closeness)
- Community detection (Louvain, Label Propagation)
- Similarity algorithms (Jaccard, Cosine)

## Timeline
4-5 weeks | Depends on: Phase 12
