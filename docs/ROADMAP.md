  - Hash(node_id) → shard_id assignment via xxh3 (`assignment.rs`)
  - Relationships reside with source node
  - Generation-tagged metadata (`metadata.rs`)

  - Shard health monitoring (`health.rs`) with majority/TTL rules

**Test Coverage**: 143 unit tests in `sharding::`

### 3.2 Consensus per shard ✅

- ✅ **Raft** (`nexus-core/src/sharding/raft/`)
  - Native Nexus implementation (purpose-built; openraft is still
    0.10-alpha and its trait surface would need more adapter code
    than the Raft itself)
  - Leader election within 3× election timeout (spec bound asserted)
  - Log replication with §5.3 truncate-on-conflict semantics
  - §5.4.2 leader-only commit-from-current-term
  - Snapshot install round-trip

**Test Coverage**: 65 unit tests including 3/5-node failover,
partition-tolerance, follower catch-up, single-node bootstrap.

### 3.3 Distributed Queries ✅

- ✅ **Query Coordinator** (`nexus-core/src/coordinator/`)
  - Plan decomposition (`plan.rs`)
  - Classification: `SingleShard` / `Targeted` / `Broadcast`
    (`classify.rs`)
  - Pushdown-ready subplan shape
  - Cross-shard traversal + LRU cache + budget (`cross_shard.rs`)

- ✅ **Execution Runtime** (`scatter.rs`)
  - Scatter/gather with atomic per-query failure
  - Leader-hint retry (3 attempts), stale-generation refresh (1 pass)
  - Query timeout, shard timeout, merge operators

**Test Coverage**: 46 unit tests + 12 integration scenarios.

### 3.4 Cluster Operations ✅

- ✅ **Cluster Management**
  - `/cluster/status`, `/cluster/add_node`, `/cluster/remove_node`,
    `/cluster/rebalance`, `/cluster/shards/{id}` endpoints
  - Admin-only authorization via existing RBAC
  - `307 Temporary Redirect` on follower write attempts
  - Drain semantics for graceful node removal

- 🔮 **Disaster Recovery** (deferred to V2.1)
  - Multi-region replication
  - Cross-datacenter latency handling
  - Backup coordination

**Test Coverage**: controller + HTTP handlers covered; 14 controller
unit tests + API endpoints wired into `/cluster/*`.

**V2 Deliverable**: ✅ Distributed graph database with multi-node
scalability — sharding, per-shard Raft consensus, distributed query
coordinator, cross-shard traversal, cluster management API. Total:
**201 tests** dedicated to V2 sharding (143 sharding + 46 coordinator
+ 12 E2E integration). All quality gates passing on nightly.
