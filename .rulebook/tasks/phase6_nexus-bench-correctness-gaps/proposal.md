# Proposal: close the correctness gaps `nexus-bench --compare` surfaced

## Why

The first full comparative run of the bench harness on
2026-04-20 (against a release `nexus-server` + docker
`neo4j:latest` on Bolt :7687) produced the expected
latency-domination story — Nexus leads in 23 / 28 scenarios,
parity in 3, ⚠️ behind in 2, no 🚨 gap — but the
content-divergence guard (commit `8a790d06`) flagged **eight
scenarios where Nexus's answer is wrong**. Latency ratios on
those scenarios compare apples to oranges: a 0.53× on
`traversal.small_one_hop_hub` is meaningless when Nexus returns
99 and Neo4j returns 5.

This task tracks the fixes for those eight divergences. As each
lands, the bench is re-run, the numbers in this file's *current
state* section move from "wrong" to "matched", and eventually
the full catalogue runs content-clean.

## Bench runs (append-only log; one entry per re-run)

Snapshots live under
`docs/benchmarks/baselines/`. Every row references the exact
Nexus commit the bench ran against so a latency regression
(or a fix) has a commit to point at.

### Run 4 — 2026-04-20 · Nexus commit `4b8ece39` · 38 catalog / 37 ran

Catalogue grew to 38 after `scalar.string_concat`,
`scalar.list_indexing`, `scalar.case_simple`,
`write.create_delete_cycle` landed. The three scalars all pass
clean; the write-cycle scenario exposes a new Nexus restriction.

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| ⭐ Lead | 31 |
| ✅ Parity | 4 |
| ⚠️ Behind | 0 |
| 🚨 Gap | 2 |
| content-divergent | 11 (same set as Run 3, one row fewer because `subquery.with_filter_count` hit expected-rows error this run instead of content mismatch — same bug) |
| bench-aborting errors | 3 (`procedure.db_indexes`, `subquery.with_filter_count`, `write.create_delete_cycle`) |

New finding vs Run 3:

- `write.create_delete_cycle` — Nexus rejects
  `CREATE (n:BenchCycle) WITH n DELETE n RETURN 'done' AS status`
  with the parse-time error **"DELETE requires MATCH clause"**.
  Neo4j accepts the same statement. The WITH binding from the
  CREATE should satisfy DELETE's node-context requirement, but
  Nexus only accepts DELETE when a MATCH is the direct upstream.
  New §8 below.

Snapshot: `docs/benchmarks/baselines/2026-04-20-run4.{md,json}`.

### Run 3 — 2026-04-20 · Nexus commit `6a9983f4` · 34 scenarios

Catalogue grew to 34 after `procedure.db_indexes`,
`subquery.unwind_sum`, `subquery.with_filter_count`,
`subquery.size_of_collect` landed — spreading the surface
across procedure / UNWIND / WITH-pipeline / list-function
territory.

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| ⭐ Lead | 26 |
| ✅ Parity | 4 |
| ⚠️ Behind | 2 |
| 🚨 Gap | 2 |
| content-divergent | **13** |
| bench-aborting errors | **1** |

New findings vs Run 2:

- `procedure.db_indexes` — Nexus's parser rejects
  `CALL db.indexes() YIELD *` (column 25). Add `YIELD *`
  support or rewrite the scenario with explicit yield
  columns. Also independently the procedure is likely
  broken the same way `db.labels()` is — §3 territory.
- `subquery.with_filter_count` — `MATCH (n:A) WITH n.score AS s
  WHERE s > 0.1 RETURN count(*) AS c` returns zero rows on
  Nexus. Neo4j returns 1. Probably the same root as §5
  (WITH → RETURN pipeline collapses) but with a WHERE in
  between; if §5 fix covers it, this scenario turns green
  automatically.
- `subquery.size_of_collect` — `MATCH (n:A) WITH
  collect(n.id) AS ids RETURN size(ids) AS s` returns the
  raw list `[0..19]` instead of 20. `size()` call is not
  being evaluated; the WITH projection leaks straight
  through. Maps to §5.
- `order.bottom_5_by_score` — the same null-positioning bug
  from §7, but in the ASC direction: Nexus puts null first
  in ASC, openCypher says null goes last. One fix covers
  both directions.

Snapshot: `docs/benchmarks/baselines/2026-04-20-run3.{md,json}`.

### Run 2 — 2026-04-20 · Nexus commit `6a9983f4` · 32 scenarios

Catalogue grew to 32 after `traversal.cartesian_a_b`,
`write.create_singleton` (literal mark, not id), `write.merge_singleton`,
`write.set_property` landed. Shortest-path scenario (§3.5)
pulled temporarily — Nexus parser does not accept
`shortestPath((…)-[*]->(…))` yet.

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| ⭐ Lead | 26 |
| ✅ Parity | 4 |
| ⚠️ Behind | 0 |
| 🚨 Gap | **2** |
| content-divergent | **10** |

New divergences vs Run 1:

- `aggregation.avg_score_a`: float-accumulation order drift
  — Nexus `0.09499999999999999`, Neo4j `0.09500000000000003`.
  Both are wrong to different ULPs. Classified as §6 below
  (likely non-blocking, but documented).
- `order.top_5_by_score`: with SmallDataset + TinyDataset
  both loaded, SmallDataset nodes have a null `score`. Neo4j's
  `ORDER BY n.score DESC` puts nulls first in DESC, so the
  top 5 are null-named SmallDataset rows. Nexus returns
  TinyDataset's `n0` instead — Nexus's null ordering differs.
  Classified as §7 below.

Gaps (performance, not correctness):

- `traversal.cartesian_a_b`: Nexus **735 957 µs** vs Neo4j 2 559 µs
  (**287× slower**). Cartesian (`MATCH (a:A), (b:B) RETURN count(*)`)
  builds a 400-row intermediate on both engines but Nexus's
  materialisation is dramatically slower. Not a correctness
  bug; worth its own task if the comparison ever becomes a
  priority.
- `write.set_property`: 4 678 µs vs 2 174 µs (2.15×, just past
  the Gap threshold). Within noise of ⚠️ Behind.

### Run 1 — 2026-04-20 · Nexus commit `04b874c8` · 28 scenarios

First real comparative run.

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| ⭐ Lead | 23 |
| ✅ Parity | 3 |
| ⚠️ Behind | 2 |
| 🚨 Gap | 0 |
| content-divergent | **8** |

Snapshot: `docs/benchmarks/baselines/2026-04-20-baseline.{md,json}`.

The eight originally-surfaced bugs sit below. Every entry names
the exact scenario that caught it so the re-run after each fix
points at the row that just turned green.

## What Changes

Each bug lives in `crates/nexus-core`. The bench keeps driving
them — no bench-side code changes are needed to land the fixes.

### 1. Composite `:Label {prop: value}` filter ignored (HIGH)

Caught by:
- `traversal.small_one_hop_hub`: Nexus=**99**, Neo4j=5
- `traversal.small_two_hop_from_hub`: Nexus=**97**, Neo4j=5

Reproducer (against a database with TinyDataset + SmallDataset
both loaded):

```cypher
MATCH (:P {id: 0})-[:KNOWS]->(b) RETURN count(b) AS c
-- expected: 5 (the five neighbours of SmallDataset's p0)
-- observed: 99 (looks like every KNOWS edge whose tail is any node,
--               i.e. `:P` + `{id: 0}` together got dropped)
```

Label-only (`MATCH (:P)...`) and property-only
(`MATCH (x {id: 0})...`) work; the interaction of the two in a
single pattern element is the broken layer.

### 2. Variable-length path `*m..n` returns empty (HIGH)

Caught by:
- `traversal.small_var_length_1_to_3`: Nexus=**0**, Neo4j=15

Reproducer:

```cypher
MATCH (:P {id: 0})-[:KNOWS*1..3]->(n) RETURN count(DISTINCT n) AS c
-- expected: 15 (5 at 1-hop + 5 at 2-hop + 5 at 3-hop from the hub)
-- observed: 0 (variable-length expansion returns empty set)
```

Partly downstream of §1 (the anchor filter is the same shape),
but `MATCH (a)-[:KNOWS*1..3]->(n)` without the label scope is
worth a separate reproducer to isolate.

### 3. `db.*` procedures return 0 counts (MEDIUM — three scenarios)

Caught by:
- `procedure.db_labels`: Nexus=**0**, Neo4j=6
- `procedure.db_relationship_types`: Nexus=**0**, Neo4j=1
- `procedure.db_property_keys`: Nexus=**0**, Neo4j=205

Reproducer:

```cypher
CALL db.labels() YIELD label RETURN count(label) AS c
-- expected: 6 on the merged fixture (A,B,C,D,E,P)
-- observed: 0
```

The procedure runs, returns a single row with `count(label) =
0`, but the catalog actually has six labels. Either
`db.labels()` yields an empty stream, or `YIELD label` is not
passing rows downstream.

### 4. Integer arithmetic returns a float (LOW)

Caught by:
- `scalar.arithmetic`: Nexus=**7.0**, Neo4j=7

```cypher
RETURN 1 + 2 * 3 AS n
-- expected: integer 7
-- observed: floating-point 7.0
```

Nexus promotes integer-only expressions to `f64`. Affects
every integer result that happens to cross the expression
evaluator. Real-world impact modest; test fixtures that
compare against `json!(7)` trip.

### 5. `WITH` → `RETURN <expr>` leaks WITH payload (MEDIUM — three scenarios)

The post-WITH RETURN clause is being dropped — every scenario
whose RETURN applies a function or boolean expression to
WITH-projected variables gets the raw WITH payload back
instead of the expression's value.

Caught by:

- `subquery.exists_high_score`: Nexus=**[0.99, 150]**,
  Neo4j=false
  ```cypher
  MATCH (n) WITH count(n) AS total, max(n.score) AS hi
  RETURN hi > 0.99 AS any_high
  -- expected: Bool(false) (0.99 is not strictly > 0.99)
  -- observed: [hi, total] raw instead of evaluating
  --           `hi > 0.99`
  ```
- `subquery.size_of_collect`: Nexus=**[0..19 list]**, Neo4j=20
  ```cypher
  MATCH (n:A) WITH collect(n.id) AS ids RETURN size(ids) AS s
  -- expected: Number(20)
  -- observed: the collect'ed list leaks through unchanged;
  --           `size(ids)` is not evaluated
  ```
- `subquery.with_filter_count`: Nexus=**0 rows**, Neo4j=1 row
  ```cypher
  MATCH (n:A) WITH n.score AS s WHERE s > 0.1 RETURN count(*) AS c
  -- expected: 1 row (count aggregation always produces one)
  -- observed: zero rows — the aggregation after the WHERE
  --           returned nothing, or the whole pipeline
  --           short-circuited
  ```

All three strongly suggest the RETURN clause after a WITH is
either not being planned or its expression is being silently
replaced with the WITH column projection.

### 6. Float-accumulation order in `avg()` (LOW — diagnostic)

Surfaced in Run 2 by `aggregation.avg_score_a`:

```cypher
MATCH (n:A) RETURN avg(n.score) AS s
-- Nexus: 0.09499999999999999
-- Neo4j: 0.09500000000000003
```

Both engines are within 4 ULPs of 0.095, so neither is
"correct" in IEEE-754 terms — the difference is summation
order. Classifying as LOW because the user-facing impact is
minor (no sane test asserts on the 15th decimal). Worth
documenting so nobody chases it as a "bug" — it's an
engineering tradeoff (Nexus likely sums naively, Neo4j may
use Kahan compensation or a different block order).

Fix direction: pick one of
(a) Nexus switches to Kahan summation in `sum()` / `avg()`
(b) the divergence guard tolerates a per-ULP epsilon on
floats
(c) leave as-is and declare the divergence informational.

### 7. `ORDER BY` null-positioning inverted in both directions (MEDIUM — two scenarios)

Caught by both `order.top_5_by_score` (DESC, Run 2) and
`order.bottom_5_by_score` (ASC, Run 3):

```cypher
-- DESC (openCypher: nulls first)
MATCH (n) RETURN n.name ORDER BY n.score DESC LIMIT 5
-- Nexus: "n0"   (nulls sorted LAST — wrong)
-- Neo4j: null   (nulls sorted FIRST — correct)

-- ASC (openCypher: nulls last)
MATCH (n) RETURN n.name ORDER BY n.score ASC LIMIT 5
-- Nexus: null   (nulls sorted FIRST — wrong)
-- Neo4j: "n0"   (nulls sorted LAST — correct)
```

Nexus sorts nulls with the wrong polarity in **both** DESC
and ASC. openCypher: DESC → nulls first, ASC → nulls last.
Medium severity because `ORDER BY` is everywhere; fix is a
single polarity flip in the comparator.

### 8. `DELETE` rejects CREATE→WITH-flow context (MEDIUM)

Caught by:
- `write.create_delete_cycle` (Run 4): Nexus parse-time error
  **"DELETE requires MATCH clause"**

```cypher
CREATE (n:BenchCycle) WITH n DELETE n RETURN 'done' AS status
-- Neo4j: executes the statement; 1 node created + deleted; returns 'done'
-- Nexus: parse error, "DELETE requires MATCH clause"
```

The DELETE clause should accept any node binding already in
scope — whether that came from `MATCH`, `CREATE`, or a prior
`WITH`. Nexus's current check insists the node variable comes
from a MATCH. Blocks iteration-safe create-then-delete
patterns in the bench, and — more importantly — any real
transactional flow that creates temp data and immediately
cleans it up.

### Methodology

For every bug:

1. Land a failing regression test at the executor layer
   (`crates/nexus-core/src/engine/tests.rs`) — mirrors the
   pattern set by `phase6_nexus-delete-executor-bug` and
   `phase6_nexus-create-bound-var-duplication`, so the fix is
   locked in without needing a live server.
2. Fix the narrowest layer (parser / planner / executor
   operator / procedure handler / expression evaluator).
3. Rebuild `target/release/nexus-server.exe`, rerun
   `nexus-bench --compare`, update the bench table in this
   proposal's reference section with the new numbers.
4. Tick the corresponding item in `tasks.md`.

## Impact

- Affected code:
  - `crates/nexus-core/src/executor/**` — filter composition,
    variable-length path, expression evaluator.
  - `crates/nexus-core/src/executor/procedures/**` (or
    wherever `db.labels()` lives) — procedure yield wiring.
  - `crates/nexus-core/src/engine/tests.rs` — regression tests.
- Affected bench fixtures: none — the scenarios are already
  shaped correctly; they just expose Nexus bugs.
- Breaking change: NO. Every fix restores Neo4j-compatible
  behaviour that the 300-test diff suite presumably already
  expected; if any test in that suite regresses it means the
  suite was papering over the same bug.
- User benefit: the bench's `Ratio` column stops comparing
  wrong answers, the Nexus-vs-Neo4j compatibility claim gets
  an independent verification beyond the diff suite, and four
  real user-facing correctness gaps (label+prop filter,
  variable-length paths, catalog procedures, WITH→RETURN
  projection) close.
